The code for this site is INCOMPLETE
When pushing new changes to the site, make sure to plug in a few values that can't be here on the public repo

1. Enter the SQL credentials for the DB in functions.php
2. Check your include paths on the scripts, they may or may not work with your settings
3. Perhaps most important, almost none of this code has been executed. There are syntax errors and incomplete things. Watch for them
and make sure they are fixed for production, word. (this will be fixed when git and my server are back up)
4. Number 3, again.
5. Code is public, whatever. I am including a GPLv3 with this though, so if you use this code be ready to share the 
open source love :)
6. Fix SQL queries, some column names have changed

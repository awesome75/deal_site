    Welcome to the beta of our website! If you are here then you have been invited to test
    out the site and help us determine what features are working and what needs work.
    Please keep in mind that this is not the working design of the site. We plan on releasing the final 
    product with a new or at least heavily revamped design. We know it isn't the prettiest yet :)
    We ask you to please make suggestions that involve the actual features of the website(as that is
    what needs to be debugged), and not the user interface. We thank you for helping us to make the site
    better and we look forward to launching a full featured product soon.

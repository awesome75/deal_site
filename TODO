TODO list for the site:

Create HTML to display results of back end code - in progress

Rid the code of all syntax errors - in progress

Most of the code has been ran and is working decently, but we need to make it so that we can get deals in more ways 
than one

The location script is doing well. Look into speed inmprovements. Also we have lot's more to do in regards to deal 
search by location. Also there needs to be functionality to keep up our location db

Make a algorithm to rank deals based on votes, user status, and comment analysis

Make algorithm to rank comments, to help give better data to DealRank algorithm

Create an auction based advertising platform for brands to promote deals posted about them my them or someone else
and to allow them to create ads and have real time bidding and stats to analyze their campaigns

Create mobile site and apps

Transition to new record system, we will be leaving MySQL in favor of a NoSQL solution, probably Cassandra

At some point in the future rewrite the site in Python instead of PHP. Probably make a new project here on c9 for that affter
this PHP version hits production status

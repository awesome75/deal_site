# DealRank Algorithm 0.1 Beta by Chase Higgins for deals website
# TODO:
    # Multiprocessing. 
    # Write it?
    # We will need to write a few different ranking algos, make sure this code is portable
# investigate the most efficient module for Python SQL, the libraries I have used were sub par at best
# determine if PHP is faster than Python for this particular job, Python first since prototyping is faster
# Jon you will be responsible for this algorithm pretty much. Have fun man.
